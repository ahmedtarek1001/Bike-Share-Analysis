# Bike Share Data Exploration Project

This repository contains a Python-based project developed as part of **Udacity's Programming for Data Science Nanodegree Program**. The project explores and analyzes bike share system data for three major U.S. cities: **Chicago**, **New York City**, and **Washington**.

## Overview

The project script performs the following tasks:
- Reads and processes raw data from CSV files.
- Computes descriptive statistics, including:
  - Popular times of travel (month, day, hour).
  - Most commonly used stations and trip combinations.
  - Total and average trip durations.
  - User demographics (user type, gender, birth year).
- Offers a user-interactive filtering interface for city and time period selection.
